# easy-rsa-openvpn-WIZARD
Creates a client server OpenVPN config based on easy-rsa 2 from the OpenVPN project
Will be makine one for easy-rsa 3 I would think soon

Just place the wizard file in the same dir as easy-rsa 2 chmod +x and ./wizard

Just a simple bash script!  More to come.

It will output the client and server files into openvpn_client_config and openvpn_server_config
